# Contributing to OpenClaw

Welcome!

## How to Contribute

1. **Features, Bugs & small fixes** → Open a PR!

## Before You PR

- Test locally
- Keep PRs focused (one thing per PR; do not mix unrelated concerns)
- Describe what & why

## AI/Vibe-Coded PRs Welcome! 🤖

Built with Codex, Claude, or other AI tools? **Awesome - just mark it!**

Please include in your PR:

- [ ] Mark as AI-assisted in the PR title or description
- [ ] Note the degree of testing (untested / lightly tested / fully tested)
- [ ] Include prompts or session logs if possible (super helpful!)
- [ ] Confirm you understand what the code does

AI PRs are first-class citizens here. We just want transparency so reviewers know what to look for.

## Current Focus & Roadmap 

- Expose the official rollbar API via the CLI where it would be useful for automation via AI Skills
